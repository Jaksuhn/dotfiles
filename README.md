# dotfiles


These are my dotfiles, built with the express purpose of being able to go from a blank machine to *exactly* how I've had it with little-to-no user intervention required. I mess around with other window managers, so the installer will ask what profile to use. Other profiles are a very WIP feature atm (in terms of getting them setup to how I've had them). Some sort of work, some add nothing.
